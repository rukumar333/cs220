CS220 Homework 2 Due Feb. 12, 2016

Name: Rushil Kumar

1. Given the following code:
	int x = -5;
	int y = x/2;
	int z = x>>1;
	
   a. Will "y" and "z" have the same value?  If so, why? If not, why not?
   No. y will be equal to -2 because it will round up from -2.5 to -2 since it is an int. The bit shift to the right by 1 causes the new number to be -3.   
   b. Is the statement "shifting to the right is the same as dividing by two" correct?
   No. This is not always the case because when the number is not divisible by 2, such as -5, the result is not the number divided by 2. 
2. Is there anything wrong with the following code?  If so, what is the problem?

	int main(int argc,char **argv) {
		int x;
		x=getFirst(23);
		if (x==12) return 1;
		return 0;
	}
	int getFirst(int st) {
		return (st*124639 % 332167);
	}
	
     The function getFirst() needs to be declared before main.
	
3. Given the following Code:

	int x; 
	x=14;
	x=x++;
	
   What will the value of "x" be after the code is executed?  Why?
   The value will be 14 because the x is incremented by one after it returns the original value (in this case 14).
	
4. Given the following invocation of a commmand generated from C code:

	./mycmd this is a test
	
   What will be the values of:
   
   a. argc
   b. argv[1]

   argc will be 5
   argv[1] will be "this"
   	
5. Given the following C code:

	int x=atoi(argv[1]);
-	int y=(x | (-1-x));
	if (y==-1) printf("Does OR act the same as ADD?\n");
	
   Is there any value of x for which you will NOT print "Does OR act the same as ADD?"?
   No.
   If so, what is that value?
