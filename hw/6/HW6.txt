CS220 Week 6 Homework Due Mar 18, 2016

Name: Rushil Kumar

1. What is the difference between a return value and a return address?
     When the value is returned, then the value is copied and returned. However, when the address is returned, the address of the actually value itself is returned. The value is not returned but now the value could be altered because the memory address is accessible.
2. Assuming full data alignment is enforced, given the following code...
   
	   struct shape {
	   	enum color {red, green, blue} shapeColor;
		int width;
		int height;
		int depth;
	   } shapeA[5];
	   printf("Shape matrix starts at %p\n",shapeA);
	   printf("The shapeA[1] starts at %p\n",shapeA+1);
	   
    If the first message prints out: "Shape matrix starts at 0x5fcad0"
    What will the second message print?
    The shapeA[1] starts at 0x5fcae0
	   
3. Given the following C code...

	enum strikers { Giroux, Bony, Rooney, Hazard, Aguero, Costa, Kane } player;
	enum teams { Arsenal, ManCity, ManU, Chelsea, Tottenham } team;
	
   Would the following C code compile without error?
	
	if (player==Giroux) team=Arsenal;
	else if (player==Bony) team=ManCity;
	else if (player==Rooney) team=ManU;
   Yes it will compile without error. However, there will be warnings because the the player and team variable are not initialized.
  
4. Given the following C code...

	int isDenormal(float x) {
		union {
			float xf;
			int xi;
		} in;
		if (x==0 || x==INFINITY || x==-INFINITY) return 0;
		in.xf=x; // Copy float parameter to union as float
		if (0== (in.xi & 0b01111111100000000000000000000000)) return 1;
		return 0;
	}
	
   a. Would the isDenormal function work correctly without the "union" statement?  Why or why not?
   No it will not work correctly. Without the union statement, "int xi" will not be initialized and will have a garbage value throughout the entire function. Its bits will never get set equal to the bits of the input "float x".
   b. What will be returned for isDenormal(1.3e-30)?  What will be returned for isDenormal(1.3e-44)?
   0 will be returned for isDenormal(1.3e-30) and 1 will be returned for isDenormal(1.3e-44).
   
5. Given the following x86 Assembler code:

			cmpl	8(%ebp),$100
			jle	L21
			addl	$1,8(%ebp)
			jmp	L22
		L21	subl	$1,8(%ebp)
		L22	movl	8(%ebp),%eax
			…	
			
    Which of the following lines of C code caused the above assembler code to be generated?
    c.	if (arg1>100) arg1++;
	   else arg1--;
	   x = arg1;
	
	a.	while(arg1<100) { arg1++; }
		arg1--;
		x = arg1;

	b.	for(arg1=100; arg<=100; arg1++) { arg1--; }
		x = arg1;

	c.	if (arg1>100) arg1++;
		else arg1--;
		x = arg1;

	d.	do { arg1--} while(arg1>100);
		arg1++;
		x = arg1;

	e.	if (arg1<=100) arg1++;
		else arg1--;
