CS220  Homework 5 Due March 11, 2016

Name: Rushil Kumar

1. Consider the following C code...

	char * myfn(char * in) {
		char out[80];
		int i;
		for(i=0; in[i]!=0 && i < 80; i++ ) {
			out[i]=in[i] | 0x20;
		}
		return out;
	}
	
    Will this code work without error?  If not, what is the problem?
    This code has error in it because it returns a pointer to a char array. However, the memory for the char array is only valid memory inside the function since it has not been separately allocated. Therefore, when the pointer to the first position of the array is returned, the memory may not necessarily hold what was originally there inside the function. The memory being accessed will be garbage memory.
     
2. Assuming full data alignment is enforced, how many bytes are required for the following
   C structure?
   
   struct {
   	int width;
   	int height;
   	int depth;
   	short shapeID;
   } shapeA;
   16 bytes.   
   
3. Suppose you have a binary tree made up of nodes as follows...

	struct tnode {
		int value;
		struct tnode * left;
		struct tnode * right;
	}
	
    And a program has created a tree in which every left node has a value less than its parent value, and 
    every right node has a value greater than its parent value.
    
    Consider the following code:
    
    void prPost(struct tnode *root) {
    	if (root->right) prPost(root->right);
    	printf("Value: %d\n",root->value;
    	if (root->left) prPost(root->left);
    }
    
    What would be true about the order of the values printed by this program?
    The values would be printed in descending order.
    
4. Are the following statements about Instruction Set Architectures True or False:

	a. _True_ Machines that support an ISA provide a hardware interface that implements that ISA
	
	b. _True_ Any machine that supports x86-32 also supports x86-16.	
	
	c. _True_ A machine can only support a single family of ISA's, where x and y are in the same family
		if x is downward compatible with y.

	d. _True_ Many different machines support the x86-32 ISA.

	e. _False_ An operating system which runs on the x86-32 ISA cannot run on a machine that
	        does not support the x86-32 ISA
	        
5. 	Given the following register and memory values...

		Reg	| Value			Address		| Value
		--------+-----------	        ----------------+------------
		eax	| x0000 0003		xCA00 01D4	| xFFFF FFFF
		ebx	| x0000 004A		xCA00 01D0	| x0000 0000
		...	| ...			xCA00 01CC	| x0000 0064
		ebp	| xCA00 01C0		xCA00 01C8	| x0000 00C8
		esp	| xCA00 01BC		xCA00 01C4	| xB32C 302A
						xCA00 01C0	| xCA00 0208
						xCA00 01BC	| x0300 0000
						
	What will be in the eax register after the execution of each instruction below...
	
	a. 	movl  8(%ebp),%eax 
	0x0000 00C8
	
	b. 	addl  12(%ebp),%eax
	0x0000 012C
	c. 	shrl  $2,eax	        
	0x0000 004B
