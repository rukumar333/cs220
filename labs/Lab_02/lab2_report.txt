1. Copy a version of your working "factorial" function here: (Whatever data type you currently are using is OK)
double factorial(double n) {
    if(n == 1) 
	return 1;
    else
	return n * factorial(n - 1);    
}

2. What is the largest number that you can use to compute a correct factorial using "char" as the returned value?  Why?
   5. 5! is equal to 120 and 6! is equal to 720. The max signed char 127, therefore 6! does not return the correct value.

3. What is the largest number that you can use to compute a correct factorial using "unsigned char" as the returned value?
	Is this different from signed char?  If not, why not?  If so, why?
   5. It is the same as signed char because the max value for a unsigned char is 255. Therefore, 6! factorial also returns the wrong value.
	
4. What type of integer data allows factorial to return the largest correct result?  
	What is the largest argument for which factorial returns a correct result using this type?
   Both long and long long integer data types gave me the largest correct results. The largest argument was 20 that returned the correct result.
5. What is the largest value for which this program can compute an exact and correct result?
	What type of data produces this largest value?
   170 is the largest value and the data type that produces an accurate result is double.
