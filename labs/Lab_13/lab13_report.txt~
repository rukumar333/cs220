4. If there were no overhead and the machine you are running on has two CPU cores, what would you expect the parallel 
   CPU core percentage value to be?

5. Is there a difference between the answer to 4 above, and the percentage of core that the timer reported for you parallel run?  
   If so, do you have any idea why?
